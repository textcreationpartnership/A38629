            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The uſual interpretation is this: That <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> (a great Maſter in <hi>Iſrael</hi> knew not, (as well how could he?) the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Regeneration, (revealed only by whiſper from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which he had not) Hence he, (deſtitute of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which was not in his power) makes an anſwer chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh and groſely carnal, (which yet no one can<note n="(4)" place="margin">Homo hominis niſi ipſo indicante non intelligit cogitatum: Quantò minùs Divinum quis poterit inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigare conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, niſi cui ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe voluerit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velare.

But how do theſe things hang together? That our Saviour (meek and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle)
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:108557:98"/> ſhould diſpoſe to blame him (who would do nothing without reaſon) for ignorance of that, he nor did know, nor could know, nor any other could well tell how he ſhould! in a myſtery of Religion to be revealed, dropped only from heaven, which inſtillation, inſpiration 'tis granted he had not! Might he not well have anſwered for himſelf, Ye call me Rabbi and Maſter, and ye ſay well. for ſo I am, but how can I ſpeak, in that I was never taught, or know theſe things unleſs ſome one (from above) ſhew me? Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation I have not, why am I blamed for that I never could have? can I take what was never ſent, or receive what was never given? If this muſt come from God, and he gave it not me, how am I (though I have it not) blamed, or but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed! Whereas in the other way, blame comes home, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable, unanſwerable, unavoidable; <hi>ſc.</hi> That he was blind where he might ſee, an ignorant profeſſor of what he might know, deſtitute of the knowledg of his ſchool, the tendries of his aſſociates, the light then upon the ſtage, the learning of his place: from whence he might have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the whole buſineſs, but he a trewant or a drone neglected even the uſual tendries of his own Religion, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him what as a Doctor he refuſed, the doctrin of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And thus our Saviours increpation comes home indeed, the blow lights hard and ſmarts as he intended it: <hi>Art thou a Maſter in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and knoweſt not theſe things,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt, mighteſt, oughteſt know! thy Liturgy, thy Breviary, thy Catechiſme, thy profeſſion! the badg where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in thy profeſſing ignorance doth but blazon thy folly, and in thy long robe (that lying outſide) thy ridiculouſly incongruous ſimplicity and duncery! So the Schollar might have known, otherwiſe our Saviour would not have blamed him for want: and that without impoſſible Revelations, which were never accounted in mans power, and ſo ſhould be out of reach of blame: for the learning of his own Schools might have been in this his ſufficient inſtruction, the doctrin extant (to have been furniſhed therewith) a ſhield of ſtrength to keep off this increpation.

               <p n="2">2.

When good deſires ſhall be denyed their errand, earneſt ſuitors driven from heaven gate, They that would may not enter, but be beaten from <hi>Noah's</hi> ark, the deſires of their ſouls ſtill hovering about the windows. This is a ſad caſe. Of a good School 'tis the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to have many good Schollars, Heaven loves to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with gueſts, and the felicity of the righteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives much increaſe by their number and multitudes: Of thoſe therefore that would enter let none be kept back, of thoſe that would be admitted let none be excluded: My Father keeps open houſe, why ſhould any of his ſervants be churliſh or illiberal, ſtraightning either the hand of his bounty, or the gratefull performance of good offices from themſelves?

               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Ana-baptiſt</hi> (or rather <hi>Antipoedobaptiſt,</hi> for there is a great deal of difference, and they that would have no children Chriſtened, do yet as much diſclaim <hi>to Ana-baptize;</hi> for that which was adminiſtred in infancy, they ſay, was no Baptiſme, and in their ſeeming repetition,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:108557:102"/> they do therefore at ripe years, but begin, not renew) and having laid ſuch a foundation, much is the following uſe his importunate perverſneſs makes of it. For when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <hi>Nations</hi> to be baptized, 'tis the plain word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Chriſt willed ſo: Good, ſaith he, But he firſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them <hi>to be taught.</hi> When we reply, Federal holyneſs, Children within the Covenant, The ſons and daughters of <hi>Abraham,</hi> a faithfull Generation, a holy Seed: Be it, ſaith he, But <hi>every thing in its own order, Chriſt's Sheep hear his voice;</hi> and that is here, <hi>Teach and Baptize.</hi> When we think to ſtrike all dead by inſtance of Circumciſion the eigth day, adminiſtred to as very infants as ours can be; what made or ſuppoſed them fit, may by a parity of reaſon as well ſupply all imaginable deficiencies of ours of the ſame Covenant: Well, ſayes he, for <hi>Jehovah</hi> once ſaid ſo, to the Sons of the Old Teſtament this was Goſpel; but Chriſt hath been ſince, and he hath ſaid, <hi>A new Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement give I unto you:</hi> So that now, though not <hi>neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te rei,</hi> for the need of Inſtruction's ſake, yet <hi>neceſſitate prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti,</hi> for obedience to this Commandement's ſake, that is neceſſary, which might before be at liberty: Nor may our dutie be taken out a ſyllable ſhorter then the length of Chriſt's precept, which here forbids the profanation of what is holy in our ignorant ſervice, or that we ſtumble at a wrong adminiſtration in the dore of entrance to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (by preſſing on like bruits unbred and untaught) but we are firſt to <hi>know what</hi> is to be done (or is ſuppoſed or implyed) and then obey or receive accordingly; Believe, and then receive the Seal of Sacrament; firſt be Taught, and then Baptized.</p>
               <p>Thus is this the grand refuge of the great diſturber, his <hi>gladius</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:108557:105"/> the element applyed, which is that alone will pleaſe the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſt.</hi> How or when, is another conſideration, I only vindicate this text: one of the ſtrongeſt holds he has, that quarrels our Charity for ſuffering little children to be brought unto Chriſt by Baptiſm: And ſure, for him here is no TEACH AND BAPTIZE.</p>
               <p>I retort his choſen weapon: and what if here be much <hi>for</hi> Childrens Baptiſme? <hi>for</hi> being taught only <hi>after</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if this text and the ſure order thereof be argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative? and more, that Infants may come in with the throng <hi>(of Nations)</hi> whether they be taught or no? Both theſe, I aver, are here. For firſt, (ſetting aſide the <hi>amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bologie</hi> of the firſt <hi>Teach,</hi> as but now) in the 20 verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing we have ſure <hi>Teach;</hi> and ſure <hi>after,</hi> and neither Tranſlation nor Order can be evaded: where is the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſian</hi> now? Will he be ruled by this Text? will he have the Order regarded? ſhall <hi>Baptize</hi> AND <hi>Teach,</hi> in this ſeries of words and things unavoidable, be as authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to him, as Even now was <hi>Teach</hi> AND <hi>Baptize,</hi> if he could have made it good. Let Chriſt's words together (by his own reading) end the quarrel, who ſaith thus: <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in earth: Go therefore, Initiate all Nations, Baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> then <hi>TEACH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING them to obſerve all that I have commanded,</hi> Will now <hi>Tho. Munzer</hi> ſay, <hi>Teaching</hi> them firſt?</p>
               <p>Secondly, beſides, Infants may be Baptized: I argue from hence; for they are a part of <hi>All Nations,</hi> and <hi>All Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> ought by Chriſt's words: Let the anſwerer chuſe which to deny. If <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> or ſome Indian Prince ſhould ſend word, He and <hi>his Nation</hi> would be Baptized, why ſhould I think he excepted any, except his exception did expreſs it ſelf in ſome, as in tender babes? Or if our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors ſhould authorize me to convert and initiate <hi>the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> next New <hi>England</hi> (or in all <hi>America</hi>) and I ſhould take my Commiſſion (with my aſſociates) in very Goſpel words, from them directed, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſo as it follows, <hi>As ye go take in all the Nations,</hi> or <hi>all the people, or al the countrys,</hi> what reaſon had I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:108557:105"/> think any ſort meant to be excluded the Ark, or ſhut from admiſſion to ſociety under them, ſith they willed ALL by me to be admitted. Some one might caſt doubts, The children are unfit, they cannot take the Oath of Allegiance or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into neceſſary Engagements: But I ſpeak of their Commiſſion and my duty, what I find written in the one, and I ought to extract and ſee not left undone in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; They bid me take in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as Chriſt did, and I am to obey them in rational conſtruction: If therefore I ſhall be buſie or froward to thruſt back clildren, or any that offer or are offered, how ſhall I excuſe, being queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, who was to take in the comprehenſion of <hi>Nations,</hi> much leſs if <hi>All the Nations?</hi> though there be peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yet more in their parents or other Offerers, then I can promiſe my ſelf in <hi>Their</hi> ingenuity, or indiſcoverable fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſpoſitions, for their preſent gracious reception. It is ſure enough children are no ſure part of Families, and it ſatisfies when 'tis alleadged, that <hi>Lydia and her houſhold</hi> were baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. the <hi>Goaler, He and all his, ver.</hi> 33. <hi>the houſhold of Stephanus,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.16. that poſſibly here might be no children, for we read of none, and ſome Families alwayes have been without: But that any <hi>Nation</hi> ſhould be without children, or any thing to have its force upon <hi>Nations,</hi> that hath nothing to do with chrildren, was not heard ſince the beginning of the world, much leſs <hi>All Nations.</hi> The <hi>Amazones</hi> lived without Men for a time, and ſome ſullen Men perhaps as much without women, but that <hi>All Nations</hi> ſhould be with ut children, or not include children, is very hard to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and unreaſonable to underſtand: The quinteſſence is in this, <hi>A Nation</hi> is comprehenſive of all, (Men, Women, Children, Servants, Bond, Free,) But <hi>all Nations</hi> are here to be Baptized: Therefore—</p>
               <p>Thus the order of this text layes no rub in the way of childrens Baptiſm: the order, if any thing, requires that that which is alleadged for a rub before (TEACHING) ſhould come after Baptiſm: and Chriſt appointing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> to be Proſelyted, takes in them for a part, and ſo
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:108557:106"/> ſeems here to imply and call for their Baptiſm. Which was more then I meant, for my aim is at another thing and yet not more then needed, conſidering times and things; and that much of it may not have come under obſervation before.

               <p>Indeed, the occaſion of much error may have been, (perhaps even here) Truth: yea the derivation of truth from truth, the grounding of one truth upon another; the ſetling, I mean, of opinions warrantable enough in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, upon other as warrantable as they, but ſo incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and without coherence of any neceſſary concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of things that ſhould flow and follow, there is no dependance, nor, being compared, any eſtabliſhment they can afford mutually one to the other.

Some glance or offer whitherward the other in interpretation may chance hold forth, for none of them vvill or vvould invoke our Trinity, or act from it, but they come not home to faſten the difference full and clear vvhere it ought, in the nature of the thing, vvhich is to be a ſacrament of innovation or admiſſion to vvhom or vvhatſoever, nor in the vvay of adminiſtration to expreſs a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and preſent entry <hi>INTO</hi> this or that, which is the thing in hand.

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:108557:121"/> do or mean, this admits &amp; enters into Chriſts Church: Into what Colledg or Society ſoever <hi>ſacra ſacrilega</hi> vvould them lead; this brings unto the Congregation of Beleevers, the Church of the firſt-born, a fellowſhip with all Chriſtian ſouls: of what profeſſion ſoever of truth they ſtand at the door to let in, this gives admiſſion <hi>TO</hi> the Name (faith, religion, profeſſion) of that which none of them will allow, or not defy, Father, Son, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. Strange words! vvhich they would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre, as we defie the Divell and all his works: In the nature of a charm, vvhich they might not come neer, or as abominable as an Idoll; but we reverence and caſt our ſouls upon vvhat we derive from them; to <hi>Us</hi> there is bound up in them all our comfort and hopes for this and the next life, and vve are ſolemnly entring into the Porch of thoſe rich poſſeſſions, by them, vvill bring us further to eternall life.</p>

From the ſtrength of his parts, and depth of his knowledge: as his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions were very exact, ſo his ſpeech was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wary, and (to our purpoſe) he was one of the firſt that ever taught the four Goſpels to ſpeak
